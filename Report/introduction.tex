This is not a new area of pruducts for Followit, they have made radio sending units for over 40? years.
When new and improved technology arrives every yerar you need to make new products to have the latest most efficiant and effective systems. Every generation of a komponent will most likley have a smaller physical size, have more advanced features and draw less power The wants to make a new unit 
Customers have been asking for a simple, small and cheap radio unit from the company to complemet their more advanced and powerful GPS based products. With this type of product they could produce them in a larger number and get gain new sale teritories. By having such small product it can be used in new areas that they never could before. The smaller the aminal you want to track gets the smaller equipment you could strap to them. This is one of the reasons that this product is so sought for in the buisness. 
To get to the point of making the actual \gls{pcb} a thurough analyse of the components and their connections needs to be made. Firsly the datasheets is considered for a understanding of the component itself and the required connections for this particular implementation. Both power and data is connected and there might also be some periphials connections and chip selection that needs to be considerd. 
By writing a simple code the function of each induvidial part can be tested.  In some cases the component needs to be initialized in a specific way or it needs some other special attention which might require additional connections than it firstly seemed.
With all the specified components connected together a program is made to show all the functions and that they work as intended.
