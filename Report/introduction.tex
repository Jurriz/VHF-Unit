This is not a new area of pruducts for Followit, they have made radio sending units for over four decades now.
When new and improved technology arrives each and every year you need to make new products to have the latest most efficient and effective systems. Every generation of a component will most likley have a smaller physical size, have more advanced features and draw less power then the previous one. Followit wants to make a new unit which implement all the new and improved technologies into a small, advanced product with low power consumption. 
Customers have been asking for a simple, small and cheap radio unit from the company to complement their more advanced and powerful GPS based products. With this type of product they could produce them in a larger number and gain new sale territories. By having such a small product it can be used in new areas that they never could before. The smaller the animal you want to track, the smaller equipment you could strap to them. This is one of the reasons that this product is so sought for in the buisness. \\
To get to the point of making the actual \gls{pcb} a thorough analyse of the components and their connections needs to be made. Firstly the datasheets are considered for an understanding of the component itself and the required connections for this particular implementation. Both power and data is crucial for operation and there might also be some peripherals connections and chip selection that needs to be considerd. \\
By writing a simple code the function of each individual part can be tested.  In some cases the component needs to be initialized in a specific way or it needs some other special attention which might require additional connections than it firstly seemed.
With all the specified components connected together a program is made to show all the functions and that they work as intended.
