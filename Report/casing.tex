The \project~system has some different types of components and sensors, which all need to be housed in a watertight casing for safety and robustness. Some design ideas for this part was to make it easy to mount, small physical footprint, all the electronics in the same enclosure and watertight.
The case was revised and worked on over the whole length of the course, redefining and remodeling the construction over time.
