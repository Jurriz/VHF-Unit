To get a 4 layer board some inintial rules needs to be setup. These parameters are set by the board manufactuer. The minimum measurements are presented in \autoref{PCB_param}

One is the width of the traces. minimum of 6 mils, which equals of 0,1524mm. 
Via diameter: 10
 
\subsection{Landgridd}
The industry standard is always good to aim for, in this case the basic designs are taken from \gls{ipcg}'s design guidline\cite{ipcg}. Whilest these are made for optimal manufacturability the footprints used on the testboard are modified to enable for easier solderability, production and rework if needed. The land grids are made slightly bigger and longer to acheive this. The downside of making the pads larger is that the final board size increases and therefore the size of the land grids requires to be reduced.

\subsection{Easy prototyping}
The components that going to be used in high frequency often comes in tiny packages. This gives the protypability problems with easy ability to solder and use, but the problem is that the best components used in this area of work will be small to fit in small advanced systems. To make a
