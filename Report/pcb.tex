To get a 4 layer board some inintial rules needs to be setup. These parameters are set by the board manufactuer. The minimum measurements are presented in \autoref{PCB_param}

One is the width of the traces. minimum of 6 mils, which equals of 0,1524mm. 
Via diameter: 10
 
\subsection{Landgridd}
The industry standard is always good to aim fore, in this case the basic designs are taken from IPC's design guidline\cite{IPC}. Whilest these are made for optimal manufacturability the footprints used on the testboard are modified to enable for easier solderability, production and rework if needed. The land grids are made slightly bigger and longer to acheive this. The downside of making the pads larger is that the final board size increases and therefore the size of the land grids requires to be reduced.
