When placing test points, consider convenience. We did not have access to a bed-of-nails test bed and creating one within the span of the project, time- and budget constraints did not seem reasonable. In order to make debugging and testing easier, we placed test points at points of interest like communication buses. The test points were in the form of vias, however it would have been more convenient that they had been made larger, since the debugging tool was often an oscilloscope. The probe points did not fit the holes and they were inconveniently close together. This could have been improved.
