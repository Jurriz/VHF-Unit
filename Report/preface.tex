I would like to thank the personal at Followit to taking me in and helping me through the project time. A special thanks to Bengt Evertsson for his supervision and help. 

A big thanks goes to my supervisor Jonny Johansson at LTU for his support and guidance in the project.
And a big thanks goes to my lovley fiancee Sara Andersson for her support and strong patience throughout the whole project.
