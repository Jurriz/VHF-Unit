Surveillance and control has come a long way the last years. Every new mobile phone, most cars and smart watches have a \gls{gps} tracing device built in to it. Today it is hard to go anywhere without there beeing some sort of way of finding you. The art of finding has been around for a long time and one company that have taken the tracking aspect to the next step is Followit. For over 40 years they have built different types of \gls{gps} and radio transmitters to keep track of everything from small animals like hares and dogs to big elephants. They also got tracking solutions for vehicles like trucks and excavators.
